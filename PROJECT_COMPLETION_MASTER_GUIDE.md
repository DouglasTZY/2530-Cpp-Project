## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Code won't compile after adding new code
**Solution**:
- Check all { } braces are matched
- Verify all ; at end of statements
- Look for typos in function names
- Ensure #include statements are correct (no STL!)

### Problem: Binary search not finding products
**Solution**:
- Verify product IDs are sequential
- Check that you're searching the right array
- Test with known product IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Problem: Queue not working
**Solution**:
- Verify enqueue is called before dequeue
- Check memory allocation succeeded
- Test basic push/pop before complex operations

### Problem: Friend functions giving errors
**Solution**:
- Make sure friend declaration is INSIDE the class
- Function implementation is OUTSIDE the class
- Check spelling matches exactly

## 🎓 FINAL ADVICE

1. **Start with the easiest task** (load 50 products - 5 minutes)
2. **Add code incrementally** - compile and test after each feature
3. **Use the provided code** - don't rewrite from scratch
4. **Keep backups** - save main.cpp before major changes
5. **Document as you go** - add comments while implementing
6. **Test thoroughly** - verify each feature works
7. **Read the guides** - they're comprehensive and ready to follow

---

## 🎯 YOUR NEXT STEPS

**RIGHT NOW:**
1. Open QUICK_REFERENCE_CHECKLIST.md
2. Follow the "Start Here" section
3. Complete Step 1: Load 50 products (5 minutes)
4. Compile and verify it works
5. Move to Step 2: Binary Search

**YOU'VE GOT THIS!** 

The hardest part is already done (foundation code). Now you just need to add specific missing pieces. You have all the code ready - just copy, paste, test, and verify!
