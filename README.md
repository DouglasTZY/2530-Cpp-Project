### How to Run the System
This project was developed and tested using **Dev C++**.
1. Open the file `main.cpp` using Dev C++.
2. Ensure that **ALL** text files (`staff.txt`, `customer.txt`, `product.txt`, etc.) are located in the exact same folder as the `.cpp` file.
3. Press **F11** or go to `Execute > Compile & Run`.

> **Important Note:** If the program closes immediately after running, please check the compiled `main.exe` or run it via command prompt.
