    - Sorting by price
    - Search by ID with details
    - Purchase with quantity checks
    - Category display (Budget/Standard/Premium)
    - Stock analysis and statistics
*/
```

### Example 2: Function Documentation
```cpp
/*
  Function: purchaseProduct
  Purpose: Processes a customer purchase and updates inventory
  Parameters:
    - productID: ID of product to purchase
    - quantity: Number of units to purchase
    - customerName: Name of customer (for logging)
  Returns: true if purchase successful, false if insufficient stock
  Side Effects: Updates product.txt, sales.txt, purchase.txt, and log.txt
*/
bool purchaseProduct(int productID, int quantity, const char* customerName = "unknown") {
    // Implementation...
}
```

### Example 3: Utils Class
```cpp
/*
  Class: Utils
  Description: Utility class providing static helper methods for UI, input validation, and user interaction
